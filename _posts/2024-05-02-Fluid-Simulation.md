## Introduction
This is my final year dissertation, which require us to explore knowledge that we want to know.

## Implementation
This is all new information and knowledge when I work on this project. All of this code are supported by SFML and ImGui to change the variables. 
You can also include code snippets or diagrams to explain your implementation.

## Results

You can include screenshots or images demonstrating the output of your OpenGL Triangle project.
