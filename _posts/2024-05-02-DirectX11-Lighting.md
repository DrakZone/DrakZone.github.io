## Introduction
This is a learning and experiment project for me to learn more about Lighting in games using the help of DirectX11 and ImGui.

## Implementation
This started as a learning step for me wanting to learn more about adding lighting into my games and needed a place to expermient on what I learnt from a book. This also a place for me to experiment different type of light and how they look like in a void with a cube at the center.
You can also include code snippets or diagrams to explain your implementation.
