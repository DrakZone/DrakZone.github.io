## Introduction
This is a basic python code on Machine Learning both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithm

## Implementation
This is where I started learning both python and Machine learning. It is my first time and a summary of all my knowledge on both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
You can also include code snippets or diagrams to explain your implementation.
