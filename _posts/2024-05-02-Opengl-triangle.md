## Introduction
This Project is a learning step for me to explore opengl and explore how to create an 2D object on a screen.

## Implementation
In this project I created a triangle using the "glDrawArrays" command to draw a shape on the screen to view.
You can also include code snippets or diagrams to explain your implementation.
