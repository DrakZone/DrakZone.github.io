## Introduction
This is a project that I had done during a GameJam. I created this based on the game space invaders and trying to replicated it with different images. This game is written using SFML.

## Implementation
Using SFML here I implimented my knowledge of classes and object oriented programming to code this game as efficiently as possible.
You can also include code snippets or diagrams to explain your implementation.

## Results

You can include screenshots or images demonstrating the output of your OpenGL Triangle project.
