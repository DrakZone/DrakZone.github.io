## Introduction
This is a project written for my assignment using DirectX11. This is a code for me to learn and experiment on 3D shapes using DirectX11. It is also the first of me implimenting it into a game.

## Implementation
Rendering 3D shapes using DirectX11. This game is the first game I made using 3D shapes. This project contain simple top down game which require the player (a cube) to capture as many points (pyrammid) as possible while dodging projectile.
You can also include code snippets or diagrams to explain your implementation.

## Results
